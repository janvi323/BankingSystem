## Customer Profile Delete Feature Implementation

I have successfully added the delete functionality to the customer profile page. Here's what has been implemented:

### üóëÔ∏è **Delete Feature Overview**

**What it does**: Allows administrators to delete customer profiles directly from the customer profile page (`/customers/{id}`)

**Security**: Only administrators can delete customers, and they cannot delete their own account

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### 1. Backend API Endpoint
- **Route**: `DELETE /api/customers/{id}`
- **Controller**: `CustomerController.java`
- **Security Checks**:
  - Must be logged in
  - Must be an admin
  - Cannot delete own account
- **Returns**: Success/error messages

#### 2. Service Layer
- **Method**: `CustomerService.deleteCustomer(Long id)`
- **Returns**: `boolean` (true if deleted successfully, false if not found)
- **Error Handling**: Throws runtime exception for database errors

#### 3. Frontend UI
- **Delete Button**: Only visible to administrators
- **Confirmation Modal**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **User Feedback**: Success/error messages via alerts
- **Navigation**: Redirects to customers list after successful deletion

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

1. **Authorization Check**: Only admins can access delete functionality
2. **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
3. **Session Validation**: Proper authentication required
4. **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions

### üé® **User Experience**

1. **Visual Design**: Red delete button with warning icon
2. **Confirmation Modal**: 
   - Clear warning message
   - "This action cannot be undone" notice
   - Cancel and Delete options
3. **Responsive Feedback**: Loading states and error messages
4. **Navigation**: Auto-redirect after successful deletion

### üì± **User Flow**

1. **Access**: Admin navigates to customer profile
2. **Delete**: Clicks "Delete Customer" button
3. **Confirm**: Modal appears with confirmation dialog
4. **Execute**: Admin confirms deletion
5. **Feedback**: Success message and redirect to customers list

### üîç **Error Handling**

- **Not Found**: If customer doesn't exist
- **Forbidden**: If non-admin tries to delete
- **Bad Request**: If trying to delete own account
- **Server Error**: Database or system errors
- **Network Error**: Connection issues

### üìù **Files Modified**

1. **CustomerController.java**: Added DELETE endpoint
2. **CustomerService.java**: Enhanced delete method with return value
3. **customer-profile.jsp**: Added delete button and modal

### üöÄ **How to Use**

1. **Login as Admin**: Only administrators can see the delete button
2. **Navigate to Profile**: Go to any customer's profile page
3. **Click Delete**: Red "Delete Customer" button at bottom of profile
4. **Confirm**: Click "Delete" in the confirmation modal
5. **Success**: Redirected to customers list with success message

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Irreversible Action**: Deleted customers cannot be recovered
- **Admin Protection**: Admins cannot delete their own accounts
- **Database Integrity**: Related data (loans, etc.) should be handled appropriately
- **Audit Trail**: Consider logging deletion actions for audit purposes

The delete functionality is now fully integrated and ready for use!
