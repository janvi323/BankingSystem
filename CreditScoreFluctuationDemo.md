# Credit Score Fluctuation Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a credit score fluctuation system that automatically adjusts customer credit scores based on loan approvals and rejections.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Credit Score Service Enhancements
- **Location**: `credit-score-service/src/main/java/com/bankingsystem/creditscore/service/CreditScoreService.java`
- **New Method**: `updateCreditScoreForLoanStatus(Long customerId, String loanStatus, Double loanAmount)`
- **Algorithm**: 
  - **Approved Loans**: Increases credit score (base +10 points)
  - **Rejected Loans**: Decreases credit score (base -7 points)
  - **Amount Impact**: Larger loans have greater impact on score changes
    - Small loans (< ₹50K): 1x multiplier
    - Medium loans (₹50K-₹200K): 1.5x multiplier  
    - Large loans (> ₹200K): 2x multiplier
  - **Score-based Adjustments**:
    - Lower credit scores get higher boosts on approval
    - Higher credit scores get smaller penalties on rejection
  - **Range Protection**: Ensures scores stay within 300-850 range

### 2. REST API Endpoint
- **Location**: `credit-score-service/src/main/java/com/bankingsystem/creditscore/controller/CreditScoreController.java`
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/credit-scores/customer/{customerId}/loan-status`
- **Payload**: 
  ```json
  {
    "status": "APPROVED" | "REJECTED",
    "amount": 50000.0
  }
  ```

### 3. Client Service Integration
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/bankingsystem/bankingsystem/Service/CreditScoreClientService.java`
- **New Method**: `updateCreditScoreForLoanStatus(Long customerId, String loanStatus, Double loanAmount)`
- **Purpose**: Provides interface for main application to trigger credit score updates

### 4. Loan Service Integration
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/bankingsystem/bankingsystem/Service/LoanService.java`
- **Modified Method**: `updateLoanStatus(Long loanId, Loan.Status status, String adminComments)`
- **Functionality**: Automatically triggers credit score update when loan status changes to APPROVED or REJECTED

## How It Works

1. **Loan Application**: Customer applies for a loan (status: PENDING)
2. **Admin Review**: Admin approves or rejects the loan
3. **Status Update**: `LoanService.updateLoanStatus()` is called
4. **Credit Score Trigger**: If status changed to APPROVED/REJECTED, calls `CreditScoreClientService.updateCreditScoreForLoanStatus()`
5. **Score Calculation**: Credit score service calculates new score based on:
   - Current credit score
   - Loan status (approved = increase, rejected = decrease)
   - Loan amount (larger amount = bigger impact)
   - Customer's existing credit profile
6. **Score Update**: New credit score is saved and returned

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Loan Approval
- **Customer**: John (Current Credit Score: 650)
- **Loan**: ₹100,000 for home improvement
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Calculation**: 650 + (10 × 1.5 × 1.1) = 650 + 16.5 = **666**

### Scenario 2: Loan Rejection
- **Customer**: Jane (Current Credit Score: 750)
- **Loan**: ₹250,000 for business
- **Status**: REJECTED  
- **Calculation**: 750 + (-7 × 2.0 × 0.7) = 750 - 9.8 = **740**

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed
2. **Realistic Impact**: Loan decisions affect creditworthiness
3. **Amount-Based Scaling**: Larger loans have proportional impact
4. **Profile-Aware**: Adjustments consider existing credit profile
5. **Error Handling**: Credit score update failures don't block loan processing
6. **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with timestamps

## Testing

The implementation has been compiled successfully and is ready for testing. To test:

1. Start both services (credit-score-service on port 8083, main app on port 8080)
2. Create a customer account and generate initial credit score
3. Apply for a loan
4. As admin, approve or reject the loan
5. Check customer's credit score to see the fluctuation

## Error Handling

- Credit score updates are executed asynchronously to avoid blocking loan processing
- If credit score service is unavailable, loan status updates still succeed
- Appropriate error messages are logged for debugging
- Score boundaries (300-850) are enforced to prevent invalid scores

This implementation provides a realistic and robust credit score fluctuation system that enhances the banking system's credibility and functionality.
