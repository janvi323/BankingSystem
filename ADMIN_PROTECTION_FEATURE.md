## Admin Protection Feature - Prevent Admin Account Deletion

I have successfully implemented additional security to prevent administrators from deleting other administrator accounts.

### 🛡️ **Security Enhancement Overview**

**What Changed**: Added protection to prevent any admin account from being deleted, ensuring system administrators cannot accidentally or intentionally remove other admin users.

**Why Important**: Protects system integrity by ensuring there are always admin accounts available to manage the system.

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### 1. Backend Protection (CustomerController.java)
```java
// Check if the target customer exists and get their details
Optional<Customer> targetCustomer = customerService.getCustomerById(id);
if (!targetCustomer.isPresent()) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body("Customer not found.");
}

// Prevent admin from deleting other admin accounts
if ("ADMIN".equals(targetCustomer.get().getRole().toString())) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("Cannot delete administrator accounts. Only regular customers can be deleted.");
}
```

#### 2. Frontend Protection (customer-profile.jsp)
```javascript
// Hide delete button for admin profiles
const actionButtons = document.querySelector('.action-buttons');
if (actionButtons && role === 'ADMIN') {
    actionButtons.style.display = 'none';
}
```

### 🔒 **Security Layers**

1. **Backend Validation**: API endpoint checks target user's role before allowing deletion
2. **Frontend UI**: Delete button is hidden when viewing admin profiles
3. **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when deletion is attempted on admin accounts
4. **Role-based Access**: Only admins can attempt deletions, but they cannot delete other admins

### 📋 **Protection Rules**

✅ **Admins can delete regular customers**  
❌ **Admins cannot delete other admin accounts**  
❌ **Admins cannot delete their own accounts** (existing protection)  
❌ **Regular customers cannot delete anyone** (existing protection)

### 🎯 **User Experience**

#### For Admin Profiles:
- **No Delete Button**: Delete button is hidden when viewing admin profiles
- **Clear Role Indication**: Admin badges clearly show account type
- **Consistent UI**: Layout remains clean without delete option

#### If Deletion Attempted (via API):
- **Error Message**: "Cannot delete administrator accounts. Only regular customers can be deleted."
- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **No Data Loss**: Admin account remains intact

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

1. **Admin viewing customer profile**: ✅ Delete button visible and functional
2. **Admin viewing admin profile**: ✅ Delete button hidden
3. **Direct API call to delete admin**: ✅ Returns error message
4. **Admin deleting own account**: ✅ Still prevented (existing protection)

### 📝 **Files Modified**

1. **CustomerController.java**: Added role check before deletion
2. **customer-profile.jsp**: Hide delete button for admin profiles

### 🚀 **Benefits**

- **System Integrity**: Ensures admin accounts are always protected
- **User Safety**: Prevents accidental admin account deletion
- **Clear Feedback**: Users understand why they cannot delete admin accounts
- **Consistent Security**: Multi-layer protection (frontend + backend)

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Only Regular Customers**: Can be deleted by administrators
- **Admin Accounts**: Are fully protected from deletion
- **Self-Protection**: Admins still cannot delete their own accounts
- **UI Consistency**: Delete button only appears when deletion is allowed

This enhancement ensures your system maintains administrative access while allowing proper customer management!
