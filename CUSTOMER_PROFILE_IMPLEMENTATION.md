## Customer Profile Feature Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the customer profile functionality for your Banking System. Here's what has been added:

### üéØ **What's New**

1. **New Route Added**: `/customers/{id}` 
   - Allows both admins and customers to view profile details
   - Admins can view any customer profile
   - Customers can only view their own profile

2. **Customer Profile Page**: `customer-profile.jsp`
   - Beautiful, responsive design matching your application's theme
   - Displays comprehensive customer information
   - Color-coded credit scores (excellent/good/fair/poor)
   - Role badges for admins and customers
   - Avatar with customer's first initial

3. **Interactive Customer List**: Enhanced `customers.jsp`
   - Table rows are now clickable
   - Hover effects for better user experience
   - Clicking on any customer row navigates to their profile

### üîß **Technical Changes**

#### WebController.java
```java
@GetMapping("/customers/{id}")
public String customerProfile(@PathVariable Long id, HttpSession session, Model model) {
    // Authorization logic for admins and own profile access
    // Returns customer-profile view with necessary model attributes
}
```

#### customers.jsp
- Added CSS for clickable rows with hover effects
- JavaScript event listeners for row clicks
- Navigation to individual customer profiles

#### customer-profile.jsp (New File)
- Complete customer profile display
- Responsive design with purple theme
- Security checks and error handling
- Dynamic content loading via REST API

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- **Access Control**: Only admins can view all profiles, customers can only view their own
- **Session Validation**: Proper authentication checks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts

### üé® **User Experience**
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and cursor changes for clickable elements
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Back buttons and breadcrumb-style navigation
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches your existing purple/ivory color scheme
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

### üöÄ **How to Use**

1. **Start the application**: `mvn spring-boot:run`
2. **Login as admin** or customer
3. **Navigate to Customers page** (admin only)
4. **Click on any customer row** to view their detailed profile
5. **Customers can also access their own profile** via `/customers/{their-id}`

### üìù **Files Modified/Created**
- ‚úÖ Modified: `WebController.java` - Added customer profile route
- ‚úÖ Modified: `customers.jsp` - Made rows clickable
- ‚úÖ Created: `customer-profile.jsp` - New profile page

The implementation is complete and ready for testing! The feature maintains all existing security policies while providing a smooth user experience for viewing customer profiles.
